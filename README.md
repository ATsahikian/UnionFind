Simple C++ version of UnionFind structure, implemented by lazy approach with rank and path compression optimizations.
Amortized time complexity is O(mlog*n), n - number of nodes, m - amount of fuse and find operations.
log* - stands for log star not multiplication. Worst case for single operation is O(log n).
